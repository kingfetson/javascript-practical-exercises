## ‚úÖ Exercise 1: Conditional Logic Practice

**Goal**: Write a script to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero and print an appropriate message to the console.

### Steps:
1. Declare a variable named `number` and initialize it with a value.
2. Use an `if` statement to check if the number is greater than 0. If true, print "`[number] is positive`" to the console.
3. Use an `else if` statement to check if the number is less than 0. If true, print "`[number] is negative`" to the console.
4. Use an `else` statement to handle the case where the number is 0. Print "`[number] is zero`" to the console.

## üîÅ Exercise 2: Looping Through Numbers

**Goal**: Use a `for` loop to print numbers 1 through 10 to the console.

### Steps:
1. Use a `for` loop with:
   - An initial value of `1`
   - A condition that continues the loop while the value is less than or equal to `10`
   - An increment that increases the value by `1` each loop iteration
2. Inside the loop, use `console.log()` to print the current value of the loop counter.

## ‚ûï Exercise 3: Basic Function Creation

**Goal**: Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum.

### Steps:
1. Declare a function named `sum` that takes two parameters: `num1` and `num2`.
2. Inside the function, return the sum of `num1` and `num2`.
3. After the function declaration, call the function with two numbers as arguments and store the result in a variable.
4. Use `console.log()` to print the result to the console.
